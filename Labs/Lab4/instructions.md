# Sublist equality

## Write a function to test if two sublists are identical

- If the two sublists list1 and list2 are identical, return "Identical". Otherwise, return "Not identical".
- For example, if `list1[] = {1, 2, 3}` and `list2[] = {1, 2, 3}`, the expected output is "Identical".
- **Hint:** Two subsets are said to be identical if they have the same elemtns in the same order.  For example, `{2, 5}` and `{2, 5}` are identical lists.
- The amount of numbers that need to be entered are 10.
- You will need to ask the user to enter values into each list.
- Please have the random generator to enter a set of numbers that goes into a list.
- You will have 3 lists in total and each should be in its own function.
- 2 set of numbers are by the user and the random generator has its set.
- The list you can use any of the following containers:
    - deque
    - List
    - vector
