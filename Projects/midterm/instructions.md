Here are the following requirements for the next project:

1. Create a program that subtracts a withdrawal from a Savings Account, and returns the following on the screen:
    - Balance use any amount hard-coded in your code.
    - Amount withdrawn (input by user)
    - Amount deposit (input by user)
    - Interest Acrued (it is whatever equation you come up with from the starting balance)
    - Exit (Exit out of the program)
2. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the Starting balance, a message appears stating: Insufficnet Funds.  Next you will then ask the user to either exit or go back to the main menu.
3. If the withdrawal amount is a negative number, a message should appear stating: "Negative entries are not allowed."  Thereafter, you will then ask the user to either exit or go back to the main menu.
4. I need a username and password should be the 1st page before you are able to see the menu options.
5. Calculate the interest at 1% of the Starting Balance.  This should take place after the user enters their information.  It should show them their interest thus far.
6. Please make sure when there is a withdrawal or deposit I should be able to go back to the balance and see that it is changed.  For instamce, if I start with 1000 and do a deposit of 500, I should be able to go back to the menu and see that reflection in the Balance option.  The starting balance in your code should not be a constant variable it needs to be a static variable.
